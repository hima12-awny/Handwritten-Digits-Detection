# Handwritten Digits Detection
This project involves developing a neural network that can accurately recognize handwritten digits. The network is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The neural network architecture consists of multiple layers of neurons, which are trained using CNN. The trained model can be used to detect handwritten digits in real time in front of the camera.
## Getting Started
To start this project, you can clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Then, run the read_numbers_from_vid_v02.py file to train and test the neural network on the MNIST dataset.
