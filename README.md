# 📝 Handwritten Digits Detection

This project demonstrates a neural network capable of accurately recognizing handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Utilizing the powerful MNIST dataset, the network employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for robust digit recognition. The trained model can even detect handwritten digits in real-time using your camera!

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository and get ready to dive into digit detection magic. Simply install the required dependencies, and you'll be set to train and test the neural network on the MNIST dataset.

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hima12-awny/Handwritten-Digits-Detection.git
   cd handwritten-digits-detection

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Script**
  Train and test the neural network:
    ```
    python read_numbers_from_vid_v02.py
    ```
# 🔧 How It Works
* Data: Uses the MNIST dataset, a large database of handwritten digits widely used for training various image processing systems.
* Model: Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to effectively classify digits.
* Real-time Detection: The model can recognize digits from a live camera feed, showcasing its application potential in real-world scenarios.

# 📚 More About MNIST
The MNIST database consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits. Each image is 28x28 pixels, providing a balanced dataset for training and testing machine learning models.
